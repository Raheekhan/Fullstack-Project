# Fullstack

As I recently picked up Node.JS I decided to better my knowledge by taking on the task to create a website from scratch, and eventually add REST API to it, so I can create an Automated REST API framework in Java,  And at the same time create an Automated Framework based on my website, which is going to be built on Java.

I have worked with HTML and CSS when doing Automation, however I am not skilled at all when it comes to actually creating and managing HTML & CSS, so I am fully aware of the project structure mess! So I greatly appreciate constructive feedback!

The website is nowhere near done, and I don't have a clear goal yet as to what I am building, it is more to just gain a better understanding. 

I am using Express, Mongoose for Database (User can signup or use contact form), EJS (for easy templating, reduce code in HTML).
